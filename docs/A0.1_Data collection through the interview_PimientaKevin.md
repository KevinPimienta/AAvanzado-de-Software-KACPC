    ##### **1. Bernal Arellano Roberto**
    The making of this activity was so useful, not only because it helped me to know how to make an intervew, it helped too to be able to know that the system we were working on was something more like Springer than the thing i thought it was. Knowing the kind of system it is (KMS) can lead us to consider all the features that this platform can have to provide a complete platform to share, read and upload knowledge to and with other people.
    ##### **2. Cisneros Acosta Jose Enrique**
    During this activity, doing the interview, it helped me learned about the requirements and how to understand the client and how to express their ideas, I realized that the making of project isn't a easy process, the main idea is to do what the client wants and us as a programmer we have to bring what they want to life, apart from that it was a great experience having a demostration of what is ahead of us.
    ##### **3. Pimienta Castillo Kevin Aryam Christopher**
    While reviewing the answers that the “stockholder” provided to our team and the other ones, I realized that it seemed like a system that resembles a combination of pages like ResearchGate and Quora. When reasoning the answers and the characteristics of the case 3, i noticed that the system is actually a KSM system that I have never used before. The “search bar” is a tool that the system will have, and this is one of the most distinctive tools of the KSM systems. After understanding that, we begun to break down the characteristics of the system.
    ##### **4. Sandoval Salazar Esmeralda**
    Through the interviews we were able to know what content the client wants for the user and is unveiled that's what it should take, you could also see that a clear interview is always the best option for you  the interviewee answers as correctly as possible one of the complications we had when you asked the questions it was that you didn't have the clear concept but as the questions went ahead ideas ended.
