    - [x] Physical View: Distribution Diagram
<br />
2. Each diagram shall contain at least 3 elements within its representation.

   - [x] Use cases (Include at least 5 elements of the diagram)

## Conclusions 

*  **Bernal Arellano Roberto:**  Krutchen's 4+1 Architecture describes the software systems architecture with the help of multiple views that describes, in our case, the plaform from points of view for our target users, developers and interested people. The explanation of our platform becomes more easy to understand thanks to this, all this because here are explanated the process, development, interactions (of users with the platform), the communications of every systems element with another and the way our platfom works.
  
*  **Cisneros Acosta Jose Enrique:** Thanks to the 4 + 1 architecture, we can understand in a different and exact way the diagrams that are made when creating a project and know its function.
  
*  **Pimienta Castillo Kevin Aryam Cristopher:** The Kruchten 4 + 1 model allowed us to see a simplified description of the system through its four views and the stage view.

*  **Sandoval Salazar Esmeralda:**  In conclusion, the use of 4 +1 architecture are the same diagrams, but based on the use of multiple concurrent views, which are used to illustrate from any selected point or view the four views the important thing about this architecture is to resolve the errors and find the right solutions.
